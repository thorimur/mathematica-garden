# Welcome!

...Oh, hello there! I was just pruning these definitions back. Welcome to my Mathematica garden.

Here, I grow a little collection of notebooks and packages. You're welcome to poke around; let me walk you through the layout.

## Layout

Each notebook or package is located in its own folder at the top level.

For **notebooks**, that folder contains the notebook file itself, plus a pdf of the notebook. This lets you preview the notebook and see any graphics in it without first downloading it and opening it yourself.

Folders for **packages** usually have the package itself plus a demonstration notebook and an associated pdf for viewing that notebook.

Package files (`*.wl` or `*.m`) are more amenable to being viewed in github directly, given that they're almost always just text.
